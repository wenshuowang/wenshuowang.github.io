Hi! I am a Tenure-Track Full Professor with the Department of Mechanical Engineering at [Beijing Institute of Technology(BIT)](https://me-english.bit.edu.cn/), Beijing, China, where I earned my Ph.D. degree in 2018, receiving the Best Dissertation Award. During my academic journey, I have had the privilege of collaborating with [J. Karl Hedrick](https://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/in-memoriam/files/karl-hedrick.html), [Changliu Liu](http://icontrol.ri.cmu.edu/), [Xuanlong Nguyen](http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~xuanlong/). Before joining BIT, I held the position of Postdoctoral Fellow  (2018-2023) with [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/), [UC Berkeley, DeepDrive](https://deepdrive.berkeley.edu/) and [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/). Additionally, from 2015 to 2018, I engaged as a visiting graduate student at [UC Berkeley](https://me.berkeley.edu/faculty/) and [University of Michigan](https://me.engin.umich.edu/).

My primary research focus is on <span style="color:gray">**BehAvioral intElligence for autonomous Systems (BAYES)**</span>, a multidisciplnary field that combines insights from computational cognitive science with machine learning theory. I am dedicated to enhancing AI-based agents's efficiency, safety, and intelligence when interacting with humans. My research endeavors are guided by the objective of developing theoretical frameworks and practical algorithms to better understand human interactions. I employ **Bayesian learning** and **optimization**, underpinned by **computational cognitive sciences** to contribute to the realization of <span style="color:gray">**Socially Interactive Autonomous Mobility (SIAM)**</span>. SIAM aims to create a truly safe and reliable system that centers on the human experience, particularly in the domain of driving. My research interests encompass the following areas:

* Human robot interaction, Human modeling, Cognition & perception
* Autonomous vehicles, Multi-agent interaction, Human-centric systems, Personalized mobility 
* Bayesian learning, (Inverse) Reinforcement learning, Active inference, and Optimization & control
