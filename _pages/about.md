Hi! I am a Postdoc Fellow supported by [IVADO Fellowship Awards](https://ivado.ca/en/spotlight-on-our-academic-community/?programmes=postdoctoral-research-funding) at McGill University with [Lijun Sun](https://www.mcgill.ca/civil/lijun-sun). I am also fortunate to work with [J. Karl Hedrick](https://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/in-memoriam/files/karl-hedrick.html), [Changliu Liu](http://icontrol.ri.cmu.edu/), [Xuanlong Nguyen](http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~xuanlong/), [Ching-Yao Chan](https://path.berkeley.edu/home), and [Ding Zhao](https://safeai-lab.github.io/). I received my Ph.D. degree (Best Dissertation Award) in Mechanical Engineering from [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://me-english.bit.edu.cn/), China in 2018. Prior to joining McGill, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow (2018-2020) with [UC Berkeley, DeepDrive](https://deepdrive.berkeley.edu/) and [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/). In 2015-2017, I was a visiting graduate student at [UC Berkeley](https://me.berkeley.edu/faculty/) and [University of Michigan](https://me.engin.umich.edu/).

My research interest lies at <span style="color:gray">**Cognitive Autonomy & Interactive Learning (CAIL)**</span> --- leveraging insights of computational cognitive science with machine learning theory to enable AI-based agents more efficient, safer, and smarter when interacting with human. My research goal is to develop theoretical frameworks and practical algorithms to understand human interactions by employing **Bayesian learning** and **optimization** with the support of **computational cognitive sciences** toward <span style="color:gray">**Socially Interactive Autonomous Mobility (SIAM)**</span>, a truly safe and trustworthy system that places the human at the center of a superior driving experience, including:

* Human robot interaction, Human modeling, Cognition & perception
* Autonomous vehicles, Multi-agent interaction, Human-centric systems, Personalized mobility 
* Bayesian learning, (Inverse) Reinforcement learning, Active inference, and Optimization & control
